# Custom ETL Tool Using Azure Data Factory and Azure Function

## Overview
This repository contains the resources and documentation for building a custom ETL tool as a proof of concept (POC). The tool leverages Azure Data Factory and Azure Function to enhance our existing on-premise ETL solution. The goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of Azure's cloud services in handling data extraction, transformation, and loading processes more efficiently and with greater scalability.

## Objectives
- To build a scalable ETL tool using Azure Data Factory.
- To integrate Azure Function for efficient data processing.
- To compare and contrast the performance with the existing on-premise ETL solution.

## Prerequisites
- Active Azure subscription.
- Basic understanding of ETL processes.
- Familiarity with Azure Data Factory and Azure Functions.
